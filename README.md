# prediction-on-country

# I recently completed a machine learning project focused on predicting the growth of various countries using data-driven insights. My analysis leveraged correlation between growth predictors and a Quality of Life Index, with several interesting patterns emerging:

Purchasing Power Index had a strong positive correlation (0.844), indicating that higher purchasing power in a country often aligns with a better quality of life.
Pollution Index showed a substantial negative correlation (-0.900), underscoring that higher pollution tends to detract from overall quality of life.
Safety Index displayed a moderate positive correlation (0.592), linking safer environments to higher quality of life.
Cost of Living Index (0.707) and Restaurant Price Index (0.751) also showed positive correlations, suggesting that affordability and consumer pricing directly impact life satisfaction.
Finally, Climate Index had a very low correlation (0.052), revealing little direct impact on the quality of life metric in this model.
This project utilised machine learning techniques to model and visualize these relationships, creating a comprehensive view of the factors contributing to national growth and well-being. The findings serve as valuable insights for policymakers and economists, supporting data-backed decisions for enhancing quality of life globally.
